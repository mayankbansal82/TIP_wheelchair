# TIP_wheelchair

### Why?
I have always wanted to study and develop a single inverted pendulum system as it seems like a fascinating system to me. It is one of the most fundamental problems in Controls and also of relevance to the Robotics domain, especially Legged Rootics. The main question was how can I keep a beam upright? In this project, I developed a single inverted pendulum on a cart and expanded it to develop a triple inverted pendulum system on a cart which can actually be modified to represent a wheelchair system in which each links can be controlled individually. The motivation was to develop a wheelchair system based on triple inverted pendulum concept for the elderly and the injured.
